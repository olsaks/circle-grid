## USAGE

- Simply double click the index.html file to open it in a web browser OR go to: https://olsaks.github.io/circle-grid/

- The user is intended to drag and drop these circles as they please. The first circle is "pulsing" to let the user know these can be interacted with. Create as many cool patterns as you can!

## About

- This is based on photo of a light installation by the artist Dan Flavin that was taken at Dia Beacon. I chose this image because, amongst other things, I thought it lent itself well to being created digitally. I also thought it would be fun to add some interactivity to something that didn't actually have any, and create a new way to interact with the art. It also allowed me to highlight what I believe my best skills are (or at least what I am most interested in), which are interactivity of elements and creating a thoughtful UX that complements the interactions nicely.

- This is entirely done with vanilla Javascript, as I wanted to see how much could truly be done without any frameworks/libraries. If I were to make this again, I would most certainly do this in React.
