## NEXT STEPS

- I was able to dynamically create these circle elements and give them appropriate classes in javascript, however I was unable to successfully add the event listeners to these dynamically created elements in time. Instead, I created the markup in HTML. If I had more time, I would have like to figure out how to do them all dynamically as there is currently more HTML in the index file than I would like...

- Make it work on mobile by adding touch listeners and create a new UX for mobile users

- Had I been able to make it work on mobile, I would have decreased the amount circles by half most likely, and made them larger so they were easier to grab

- Perfect the spacing between the active and non active circles when a cirlce is dragged, as well as the outer glow of the circles

- Better handle the square edges when dragging a circle

- Add more interactivity, perhaps all circles would "shimmer" on load to indicate they could all be interacted with, as opposed to just the first circle "pulsing"

- Added more responsiveness to the container. I really chose to mainly focus on the functionality of it all, and making sure it all worked properly
