## USAGE

- Simply double click the index.html file to open it in a web browser OR go to: https://olsaks.github.io/circle-grid/

- The user is intended to drag and drop these circles as they please. The first circle is "pulsing" to let the user know these can be interacted with. Create as many cool patterns as you can!

## PHOTO

- Photo is included in the "images" folder.

- This is a photo of a light installation by the artist Dan Flavin that I took at Dia Beacon. I chose this image because, amongst other things, I thought it lent itself well to being created digitally. I also thought it would be fun to add some interactivity to something that didn't actually have any, and create a new way to interact with the art. It also allowed me to highlight what I believe my best skills are (or at least what I am most interested in), which are interactivity of elements and creating a thoughtful UX that complements the interactions nicely.

## NEXT STEPS

- I was able to dynamically create these circle elements and give them appropriate classes in javascript, however I was unable to successfully add the event listeners to these dynamically created elements in time. Instead, I created the markup in HTML. If I had more time, I would have liked to figure out how to do them all dynamically as there is currently more HTML in the index file than I would like...

- Make it work on mobile by adding touch listeners and create a new UX for mobile users

- Had I been able to make it work on mobile, I would have decreased the amount circles by half, most likely, and made them larger so they were easier to grab

- Perfect the spacing between the active and non active circles when a circle is dragged, as well as the outer glow of the circles

- Handle the square edges when dragging a circle better

- Add more interactivity, perhaps all circles would "shimmer" on load to indicate they could all be interacted with, as opposed to just the first circle "pulsing"

- Added more responsiveness to the container. I really chose to mainly focus on the functionality of it all, and making sure it all worked properly
